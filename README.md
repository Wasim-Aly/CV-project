Overview
The CV Project focuses on implementing key computer vision techniques, such as image processing, feature extraction, object detection, and classification using machine learning algorithms. It provides a practical demonstration of how data from images can be processed to generate insights.


Key Objectives:
Implement image pre-processing techniques.
Apply machine learning models for object detection and classification.
Build a custom pipeline for handling end-to-end computer vision tasks.
Project Structure
The project consists of the following main components:



Data: Includes raw datasets and preprocessed images.
Notebooks: Jupyter notebooks for experiments and visualization.
Source Code: Scripts and modules for image processing, model training, and evaluation.
Models: Pre-trained and custom models used for object detection and classification.
Results: Outputs such as charts and performance metrics.
Installation
To set up the project, you need to clone the repository, install the necessary dependencies, and optionally create a virtual environment for managing the project packages. Ensure that you have all the required libraries to run the models and processing scripts.



Technologies Used
The project leverages the following technologies and tools:


Programming Language: Python
Libraries: OpenCV, NumPy, scikit-learn, TensorFlow or PyTorch (depending on implementation), Matplotlib or Seaborn for data visualizations.
Usage
The project involves several steps for usage:

Load or download the image dataset and store it in the appropriate folder.
Preprocess the images to prepare them for training.
Train the machine learning models using the preprocessed data.
Evaluate the performance of the models and analyze the results using the provided scripts or notebooks.
Features
Image Preprocessing: Performs noise reduction, resizing, and transformations to prepare the dataset.
Object Detection: Implements popular object detection methods like YOLO or SSD (based on the project).
Classification: Uses machine learning techniques such as SVM or Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for image classification.
Custom Vision Pipeline: An integrated workflow from input image processing to final result output.
